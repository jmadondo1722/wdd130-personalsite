      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever been to a restaurant and you place your order with a server, then you realized that what was brought to you wasn’t what you ordered?...Well my company has a solution to this problem.
         I am a software developer and my company develops applications and websites for restaurants where clients place their orders before they reach the restaurant and then they just come to sit and dine.
         These applications have proven to be a huge success with a number of restaurants as they help reduce the contact that can be potential spreaders of COVID-19. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This site is intended for those who are outgoing and love to eat out. We also cater for those who love eating from home without going out. 
          We leave every order you make sorely in your hands, and all you need to do is place your order and go and dine or pick up. 
          That way mistakes from wrongly placed orders are less and contact is at a minimum thereby reducing the risks of Covid-19.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The site is like a bridge between clients and their chosen restaurant. 
        The time that people spend waiting for their food after placing their order will be almost the same time that they take to get to the restaurant. 
        It will literally be order to dine. This site will make it possible for people to place their orders and have access to menus for the different restaurants of their choice.
        It will also allow clients to orders and make it possible that there would be none to less room for mistakes were after waiting for what seems like ages and the food brought to them 
        isn’t what you exactly ordered. Then great question to be asked is what sets this site apart from others that do the same? 
        Well, we offer a wide variety of restaurants on our platform that the customers can choose from. The site is designed to be user friendly. 
        Those who navigate will find how easy it is to get what they’re looking for. Also there is great visuals that the customers will be able to see.

      <h3>Any questions? / What can I do on the site?</h3>
      <p>
         What restaurants can those who visit this site expect to find? Do they have all the menus from these restaurants?
         The cost of the dishes from the menu? Can I make bookings for a later date? How long does the restaurants take to make a certain dish? 
         These and many other questions can be answered by visiting the site. They could also expect to see beautiful visuals of these menus 
         from the different restaurants. The site allows those that visit to do some window shopping so to say. They could view menus from different restaurants on the site. 
         They could place orders for dining in or takeaways. They could expect to be notified of the available SPECIALS from the restaurants if there could be any.
         Also making bookings for a later date for dining is something that could be done on the site.

      </ul>
      <h3>How i do pay for my order?</h3>
      <p>
        Since everything is done over the internet, when done pacing an order the prospective customers will need to pay in full using a credit card before the order could be processed. 
        Experience, however has taught us that if some the customers don’t pay sometimes they don’t show up to dine or pick up a takeaway then the restaurant suffers a loss.
         So the customers are expected to pay for their orders before they could be made.
